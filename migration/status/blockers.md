# Migration Blockers and Risks

**Current Status**: ðŸŸ¢ No Active Blockers  
**Risk Level**: Low  

## Active Blockers

**None Currently Identified**

## Potential Risks

### 1. Test Integration Complexity
**Risk Level**: Medium  
**Description**: When updating test files to use new mock structure, we may discover edge cases or dependencies that require mock adjustments.

**Mitigation**:
- Update test utilities first to maintain compatibility layer
- Update test files one at a time to isolate issues
- Keep original test structure until all tests pass with new mocks

**Impact if Realized**: 1-2 additional work sessions to resolve edge cases

### 2. Environment Variable Edge Cases
**Risk Level**: Low  
**Description**: Some test scenarios might not properly handle environment variable validation or mock data generation.

**Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive testing of setupTestEnvironment() function
- Clear error messages for environment setup failures
- Test both valid and invalid environment configurations

**Impact if Realized**: Minor debugging session to fix specific test cases

### 3. Service Mock Coverage Gaps
**Risk Level**: Low  
**Description**: CLI command patterns in service mocks might not cover all commands used by existing tests.

**Mitigation**:
- Review all existing CLI command usage before creating mocks
- Pattern GitHub service mock responses on actual test usage
- Add command patterns incrementally as needed

**Impact if Realized**: Additional CLI response patterns needed (minimal effort)

## Resolved Issues (Historical)

### âœ… BDEV Pattern Replacement
**Issue**: Multiple hardcoded BDEV references throughout codebase  
**Resolution**: Systematic replacement with environment-driven configuration  
**Resolved**: Phase 1  

### âœ… Test Environment Setup  
**Issue**: Tests needed to work with dynamic environment variables  
**Resolution**: Created test environment management functions  
**Resolved**: Phase 1

## Risk Monitoring

### Early Warning Signs to Watch For

#### Test Integration Phase
- [ ] Any test file updates cause multiple test failures
- [ ] Mock data doesn't match expected test scenarios  
- [ ] Environment variable setup becomes complex in tests

#### Service Development Phase (Future)
- [ ] Service configurations conflict with each other
- [ ] CLI tool authentication becomes inconsistent
- [ ] TypeScript migration reveals type conflicts

### Success Indicators
- [x] All existing tests continue to pass after environment variable changes
- [x] Mock data generates correctly with different environment values
- [x] Service architecture maintains clear boundaries
- [ ] Test file updates preserve test functionality (pending)
- [ ] Service CLI mocks cover all required command patterns (in progress)

## Escalation Plan

### If Blockers Emerge

#### Level 1: Quick Fix (< 1 hour)
- Review recent changes for obvious issues
- Check environment variable setup and validation
- Verify mock data generation with different prefixes

#### Level 2: Investigation Required (1-4 hours)  
- Deep dive into test failure patterns
- Review service architecture decisions
- Consider alternative mock data structures

#### Level 3: Architecture Review (> 4 hours)
- Reassess service boundaries and responsibilities
- Consider rollback to previous stable state
- Redesign problematic components

### Decision Points

#### When to Proceed vs. Investigate
- **Proceed**: Single test failures, minor mock adjustments needed
- **Investigate**: Multiple test failures, environment setup issues
- **Pause**: Fundamental architecture problems, design conflicts

#### When to Rollback vs. Fix Forward
- **Fix Forward**: Issues are well-understood with clear solutions
- **Rollback**: Problems indicate fundamental design flaws

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- **Node.js**: Environment variable handling
- **CLI Tools**: gh, jira, claude command availability
- **File System**: Directory creation and file permissions

### Internal Dependencies
- **Phase 1 Completion**: Environment variable system must work before Phase 2 completion
- **Mock Data Structure**: Test utilities depend on consistent mock file structure
- **Service Architecture**: All services must follow same patterns

### Critical Path Items
1. Service CLI mock responses must be completed before test integration
2. Test utilities must be updated before individual test file updates
3. All tests must pass before moving to TypeScript migration
